## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1.  You have a **Google Cloud Project**.
2.  The **Google Play Android Developer API** is enabled for your project.
3.  You have created a **Service Account** and downloaded its **JSON key file**.
4.  You have added the Service Account's email address to your **Google Play Console** with the necessary permissions (e.g., "Admin" or at least "View app information" and "Manage store presence").

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

cd <repository-folder>
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration

1.  In the root of the project, create a file named `config.json`.
2.  Copy the following structure into `config.json`:

    {
      "packageName": "your.app.package.name",
      "keyFilePath": "./path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
    }
    ```

3.  Replace `"your.app.package.name"` with your app's package name (e.g., `hibernate.v2.testyourandroid`).
4.  Update the `keyFilePath` with the correct path to the Service Account JSON key you downloaded.

### 3. Running the Application
